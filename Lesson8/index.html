<h1>Few snippets of his work</h1>

<p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled 
    dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into 
    a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, 
    and if he lifted his head a little he could see his 
    brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into 
    stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover 
    <strong>strong</strong> it and seemed ready to slide 
    off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin 
    compared with the size of the rest of him, 
    <a class="external ext" href="#">link</a> waved about 
    helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he 
    thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human 
    room although a little too small, lay peacefully 
    between its four familiar walls.

    boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that 
    covered the whole of her lower arm towards the 
    viewer.</p>

    Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull 
    weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, 
    which made him feel quite sad. "How about if I sleep a 
    little bit longer and forget all this nonsense", he 
    thought, but that was something he was unable to do 
    because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in 
    his present state couldn't get into that position. 
    However hard he threw himself onto his right, he 
    always rolled back to where he was.
